In this project:

                      We mainly think about the code that should be used for the purpose of alarmclock.
                      Its full-fill the purpose of alarm clock that's should be used in a regular basis.
                      We just use a HTML tags and attributes that's should used for the purpose of making this project.
                      We also use CSS for the purpose of styling a HTML structure.
